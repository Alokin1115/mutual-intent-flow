# 🚀 Railway Deployment Fix - Build Error Resolution

## Issue Identified
Your Railway deployment is failing during the build process because:
1. Nixpacks configuration error: 'npm' is not a valid nixPkg (npm comes with nodejs)
2. Railway uses dynamic PORT assignment (not fixed port 5000)

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Port Configuration Fixed
- Updated server to use `process.env.PORT || 5000`
- Railway automatically assigns a port via environment variable

### 2. Railway Configuration Files Fixed
- `railway.json` - Railway-specific deployment configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Fixed build process (removed invalid 'npm' package)

### 3. Nixpacks Build Fix
- Removed 'npm' from nixPkgs (npm comes bundled with nodejs)
- Now only specifies 'nodejs' which includes npm automatically

### 3. Build Process Verification
- Confirmed build outputs to `dist/public/` correctly
- Static files (CSS, JS, images) are properly generated

## 🔧 Railway Deployment Steps

### On Railway Dashboard:
1. **Environment Variables** - Add these:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_connection_string
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
   ```

2. **Build Settings** (should auto-detect):
   ```
   Build Command: npm run build
   Start Command: npm start
   ```

3. **Redeploy**: Trigger a new deployment after adding environment variables

## 🎯 Expected Result
After redeployment:
- ✅ Homepage loads correctly
- ✅ API endpoints respond properly
- ✅ Database connects to Supabase
- ✅ Static assets serve correctly

## 🔍 Testing Your Deployment
1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Test the "Get Invite" button
3. Try organization email validation
4. Check waitlist signup functionality

The 404 error should be resolved with these configuration updates.
