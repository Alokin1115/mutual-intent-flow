# 🔄 Supabase Transaction Pooler Setup for Railway

## Solution: Use Transaction Pooler (IPv4 Compatible)

Your Supabase dashboard shows the perfect solution:
- **Direct Connection**: "Not IPv4 compatible" ❌
- **Transaction Pooler**: "IPv4 compatible" ✅

## ✅ Required Change

In your Railway environment variables, update the `DATABASE_URL` to use the **Transaction Pooler** connection string:

### Current (Direct - doesn't work on Railway):
```
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.gesxqputkldkrymmthyb.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### Updated (Transaction Pooler - works on Railway):
```
postgresql://postgres.gesxqputkldkrymmthyb:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

## 🔧 How to Update

1. **In Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to Settings → Database → Connection String
   - Select "Transaction pooler" (not "Direct connection")
   - Copy the URI connection string

2. **In Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to Environment Variables
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` with the pooler connection string
   - Redeploy your service

## 🎯 Expected Result

After updating to the transaction pooler:
- ✅ Database connection successful on Railway
- ✅ Full Supabase functionality restored
- ✅ Organization email validation with real data
- ✅ Waitlist signup saves to database
- ✅ All features work perfectly

The transaction pooler is specifically designed for serverless and IPv4-only environments like Railway.
