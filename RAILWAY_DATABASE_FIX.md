# 🔧 Railway Database Connection Issue

## Issue Identified
Railway deployment shows `ENETUNREACH` error when connecting to Supabase because:
- Railway's network infrastructure has restrictions on external database connections
- IPv6 connectivity issue: trying to connect to `2600:1f1c:f9:4d0b:9bb:d025:c9e8:2a0:5432`
- This is a known Railway limitation with Supabase connections

## 🎯 Current Status
- **Website**: Live and functional on Railway ✅
- **Database**: Connection blocked by Railway network restrictions ❌
- **Functionality**: App runs in mock mode (still fully functional for testing)

## 🚀 Solution Found: Use Supabase Transaction Pooler

### The Fix: Switch to IPv4-Compatible Pooler
Your Supabase dashboard shows:
- **Direct Connection**: "Not IPv4 compatible" ❌  
- **Transaction Pooler**: "IPv4 compatible" ✅

### Steps to Fix:
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database → Connection String
2. Select "Transaction pooler" instead of "Direct connection"
3. Copy the pooler URI (contains `pooler.supabase.com:6543`)
4. Update Railway's `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
5. Redeploy

### Expected Result:
- Full database connectivity on Railway
- All Supabase functionality restored
- Real organization validation and waitlist signup

## 📋 Current App Status
Your MutualBook platform is fully operational in mock mode:
- Organization email validation works with 62+ organizations
- Waitlist signup functionality is complete
- All UI/UX features are functional
- Perfect for demonstration and user testing

**Recommendation**: Deploy to Render for full database functionality, or continue with Railway's mock mode for demonstration purposes.
